<h3>TLA+ Use at Amazon</h3>

A technical report describing TLA+ use at Amazon is available
<a href="amazon.html">here</a>.

<h3><a name="open-source">TLA+ Tools Now an Open-Source Project</h3>

The TLA+ Toolbox and the TLA+ Tools have been released as an open-source
project, under the <A HREF="license.html">MIT License</A>.&nbsp;  The
source code is available on 
<a href="http://tlaplus.codeplex.com">CodePlex</a>.&nbsp; 
The executable files for the Toolbox are available from a new site
accessible by a link on <a href="toolbox.html#downloading">the
Toolbox's web page</a>. 

The stand-alone versions of the TLA+ Tools can be obtained through a
new link on <a href="tools.html#downloading">the
TLA+ Tools web page</a>.

<h3><a name="webpage">New Web Site &nbsp;<font size=-1>[21 September 2012]</font></a></h3>

The <a href="http://tlaplus.net"><code>tlaplus.net</code> web site</a>
is under reconstruction.&nbsp;  For now, it has been replaced by the web
site you are now visiting, and its Forum has been replaced by the
Google group described <a href="#community">below</a>.

<h3><a name="workshop">The TLA+ Workshop &nbsp;<font size=-1>[21 September 2012]</font></a></h3>

A TLA+ workshop was held in Paris on 27 August 2012 in conjunction
with the <A href="http://fm2012.cnam.fr/">FM 2012 conference</a>.
We have posted the
<A href="http://tla2012.loria.fr/program.html">slides 
  of talks and submitted papers</A>.

<h3><a name="newversions">Coming Attractions &nbsp;<font size=-1>[21 September 2012]</font></a></h3>

The next release of the Toolbox will include syntax coloring of
PlusCal algorithms and proper pretty printing of the algorithms.&nbsp;  It
will also have significant improvements to the distributed version of
the TLC model checker.&nbsp;  Enormous speeedups should be possible by
running TLC on a network of dozens or hundreds of computers. 

<p class = "smallpar">
Improvements to the SMT solver backends will greatly enhance the
power of TLAPS, making proofs much easier to 
write.

You can use <A HREF=
   "https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/tlaplus">the TLA+ 
   Google group</A> 
to communicate with members of the TLA+ community, including the
maintainers of the tools.&nbsp;  Post a message if you have a question, want
to report a bug, or just want to tell us what you're doing with TLA+.
The easiest way to post a message is to send email to

The TLA+ tools are: the SANY parser, the TLC model checker, the
PlusCal translator, the TLATeX pretty printer, and the TLAPS proof
system.&nbsp;  These tools are all used from <a href="toolbox.html">the TLA
Toolbox</a>, an IDE (integrated development environment).&nbsp;  Downloading
the Toolbox downloads all the tools except for TLAPS, which must
be downloaded separately from 
 <A HREF="http://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/tlaps">
       the TLAPS web site</A>.&nbsp;
The tools can also be downloaded without the Toolbox to be used from a
command line, as described <a href="tools.html">here</a> (for all
tools except TLAPS)
.  
&nbsp; 

Some limitations of the tools and some enhancements to them are
described only <a href="current-tools.pdf">here</a>.

<H2>What is TLA?</H2> 


<P> TLA (the Temporal Logic of Actions) is a logic for specifying and
reasoning about concurrent and reactive systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;    

It is the basis for TLA+, a complete specification language.

<P> This Web page will be updated to reflect new work on TLA.&nbsp;&nbsp;  

I hope that all work on TLA and TLA tools will be accessible from
here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            TLP</A>
          <DD> TLP is a system for mechanically checking TLA proofs.
               It was developed primarily by Urban Engberg 
                (<KBD>ue@ccieurope.com</KBD>) when he was a
              doctoral student at Aarhus University, with help from
               Peter Gr&oslash;nning.  The page has not been updated
               since 1995, but the program should still work.
              (It uses an obsolete version of the LP theorem prover,
              which is available from the site.  It also has Emacs
              macros that were written for an old version of Emacs
              and may or may not work with newer versions.)
              A TLA+ proof system is currently being developed that
              will make TLP completely obsolete.
